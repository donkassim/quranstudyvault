# Surah Al-Asr (Chapter 103) - Verse 3 Analysis

## Arabic Text and Translation

إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ

"Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience."

## Introduction

Verse 3 of Surah Al-Asr presents the complete exception to the universal loss mentioned in verse 2. After establishing that all of mankind is in a state of loss, this verse outlines the comprehensive four-part formula for success and salvation. These four elements — faith, righteous deeds, mutual encouragement to truth, and mutual encouragement to patience — form an integrated system that, when implemented together, rescue humanity from loss and lead to true success in both worlds.

## Linguistic Analysis of the Four Elements

### 1. Faith (آمَنُوا - āmanū)

- **Root**: The word آمَنُوا comes from the root أ-م-ن (a-m-n), which conveys meanings of security, safety, peace, and trust.
- **Form**: It appears as a plural past tense verb in the third person, indicating a completed action of believing.
- **Semantic Range**: In the Quranic context, īmān (faith) means:
  - Cognitive acknowledgment of Allah's existence and unity
  - Emotional trust and reliance on Allah
  - Volitional submission to Allah's commands
- **Implied Meaning**: The use of the past tense (آمَنُوا) rather than the present continuous tense suggests that faith is a decisive commitment that has already taken place, not merely an ongoing process.

### 2. Righteous Deeds (عَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ - ʿamilū al-ṣāliḥāti)

- **Root Components**:
  - عَمِلُوا comes from ع-م-ل (ʿ-m-l), meaning "to do, to act, to work"
  - الصَّالِحَاتِ comes from ص-ل-ح (ṣ-l-ḥ), meaning "to be good, righteous, proper"
- **Grammatical Structure**: The phrase couples a verb (worked/did) with its object (righteous deeds) in the feminine plural form, indicating comprehensiveness.
- **Semantic Dimensions**: 
  - The term ṣāliḥāt encompasses deeds that are:
    - Beneficial (bring positive results)
    - Sound (free from defects)
    - Appropriate (suitable for their context)
  - The combination implies purposeful action directed toward good

### 3. Mutual Encouragement to Truth (تَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ - tawāṣaw bil-ḥaqqi)

- **Root**: تَوَاصَوْا comes from و-ص-ي (w-ṣ-y), meaning "to enjoin, recommend, advise"
- **Form**: It appears in Form VI (tafāʿala), which indicates reciprocity and mutual action between multiple parties.
- **Associated Preposition**: بِ (bi) connects the verb to الْحَقِّ (truth), indicating the content of the mutual encouragement.
- **Semantic Analysis**: 
  - The term الْحَقِّ (al-ḥaqq) means "the truth" but encompasses:
    - Reality (as opposed to falsehood)
    - Rights (what is due to others)
    - Justice (equitable treatment)
    - Moral truths (ethical principles)

### 4. Mutual Encouragement to Patience (تَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ - tawāṣaw bil-ṣabri)

- **Root**: The same verb تَوَاصَوْا is used, but now connected to الصَّبْرِ (patience).
- **Semantic Range**: The term الصَّبْرِ (al-ṣabr) has multiple dimensions:
  - Endurance (withstanding difficulties)
  - Self-restraint (controlling negative impulses)
  - Persistence (continuing despite obstacles)
  - Steadfastness (remaining firm in principles)
- **Rhetorical Significance**: The repetition of the same verb structure emphasizes that encouraging patience is equally important as encouraging truth.

## Tafsir Insights from Classical and Contemporary Scholars

### 1. Faith (īmān)

#### Classical Perspectives:

- **Ibn Kathir** states that faith is the foundation of all good and the first step toward salvation. He explains that it involves belief in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and predestination.

- **Al-Qurtubi** emphasizes that the faith mentioned here must be comprehensive, encompassing all six articles of faith, and must penetrate the heart, not merely remain on the tongue.

- **Al-Tabari** notes that faith is mentioned first because it is the prerequisite for the acceptance of all good deeds. Without faith, no deed can lead to salvation.

#### Contemporary Insights:

- **Sayyid Qutb** describes faith as "the great transformation in human perception, feeling, and behavior." He explains that it represents a complete shift in worldview that changes one's perception of all existence.

- **Muhammad Asad** interprets faith here as "conscious belief in God and all that this belief implies," suggesting a dynamic, active form of faith rather than passive acceptance.

- **Dr. Israr Ahmad** emphasizes that the faith mentioned in this verse requires not just belief in Islamic principles but a transformative commitment that reshapes one's entire life orientation.

### 2. Righteous Deeds (ʿamal al-ṣāliḥāt)

#### Classical Perspectives:

- **Ibn Abbas** is reported to have said that righteous deeds are those that Allah has prescribed and made obligatory, indicating that ritual worship forms a core component.

- **Al-Razi** elaborates that righteous deeds include both worship directed to Allah (such as prayer and fasting) and good conduct toward fellow creatures (such as honesty and generosity).

- **Al-Zamakhshari** notes that the term is comprehensive and includes all acts of obedience to Allah, both obligatory and recommended.

#### Contemporary Insights:

- **Muhammad Abduh** emphasizes that righteous deeds must contribute to individual improvement and social welfare, suggesting that their value is measured by their positive impact.

- **Maulana Maududi** explains that righteous deeds are those that align with divine guidance rather than human desire or convention, emphasizing their objective rather than subjective standard.

- **Hamka** (Indonesian exegete) highlights that the term ṣāliḥāt suggests actions that "correct" and "repair" both individual and social conditions, giving it a reformative dimension.

### 3. Mutual Encouragement to Truth (tawāṣī bil-ḥaqq)

#### Classical Perspectives:

- **Ibn Kathir** interprets this as mutual encouragement to perform all good deeds, including acts of obedience and abstention from prohibitions.

- **Al-Qurtubi** explains that this element introduces a social dimension to faith and righteous deeds, making salvation not merely an individual affair but a collective responsibility.

- **Ibn Ashur** notes that the reciprocal form (tawāṣaw) indicates that each person should both give and receive advice regarding truth.

#### Contemporary Insights:

- **Abul A'la Maududi** writes that this element distinguishes Islamic faith from monasticism by requiring believers to actively promote truth in society rather than pursue individual salvation in isolation.

- **Muhammad al-Ghazali** emphasizes that encouraging truth includes speaking against injustice and oppression in society, giving this element a strong social justice dimension.

- **Javed Ahmad Ghamidi** explains that this aspect represents the missionary dimension of Islam, requiring believers to invite others to truth and establish moral order in society.

### 4. Mutual Encouragement to Patience (tawāṣī bil-ṣabr)

#### Classical Perspectives:

- **Ibn Kathir** writes that patience is needed for both performing religious obligations and abstaining from sins, as both require struggle against natural inclinations.

- **Al-Tabari** emphasizes that patience is particularly necessary when facing hardship in the path of truth, which explains why it is mentioned specifically after truth.

- **Al-Qurtubi** notes that patience completes the formula because without it, one cannot maintain faith, continue righteous deeds, or persist in promoting truth when facing opposition.

#### Contemporary Insights:

- **Sayyid Qutb** describes patience as "the provision for the journey" on the path of faith, righteous deeds, and promotion of truth, as this path is filled with obstacles and temptations.

- **Muhammad Asad** interprets patience here as "the conscious endurance of suffering, self-denial, and other forms of hardship encountered in one's pursuit of moral goodness."

- **Khaled Abou El Fadl** emphasizes that patience in the Islamic tradition is not passive endurance but active persistence on the path of goodness despite difficulties.

## Thematic Connections to Other Quranic Passages

- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:177)** provides an expanded definition of faith that aligns with Al-Asr: "Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets..."

- **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:14-15)** distinguishes between verbal profession and true faith: "The Bedouins say, 'We have believed.'

- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2)** similarly emphasizes mutual cooperation: "And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression."

- **Surah Ali 'Imran (3:104)** commands collective promotion of good: "And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful."

- **Surah At-Tawbah (9:71)** describes believers' mutual responsibility: "The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong..."

### 4. Mutual Encouragement to Patience (tawāṣī bil-ṣabr)

- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:153)** emphasizes patience and prayer: "O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient."
