# Surah Al-Waqiah (Chapter 56) - Verses 7-56: The Three Categories of People

## Introduction

Surah Al-Waqiah (The Inevitable Event) derives its name from its opening verse, which speaks of the inevitable Day of Judgment. One of the most distinctive aspects of this surah is its categorization of humanity into three distinct groups based on their faith and deeds: the foremost (as-sabiqun), the companions of the right (ashab al-yamin), and the companions of the left (ashab al-shimal). Verses 7-56 provide a detailed description of these categories and their ultimate destinies.

### Verses 7-10: Introduction to the Three Categories

**Arabic:**
```
وَكُنتُمْ أَزْوَاجًا ثَلَاثَةً ﴿٧﴾ فَأَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ ﴿٨﴾ وَأَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ ﴿٩﴾ وَالسَّابِقُونَ السَّابِقُونَ ﴿١٠﴾
```

**Translation:**
"And you will be [sorted into] three categories. Then the companions of the right - what are the companions of the right? And the companions of the left - what are the companions of the left? And the foremost - they are the foremost."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **أَزْوَاجًا ثَلَاثَةً** (azwājan thalāthah): "Three kinds" or "three categories." The word أَزْوَاج (azwāj) literally means "pairs" or "types," indicating distinct classifications.
- **أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ** (aṣḥāb al-maymanah): "Companions of the right." The term المَيْمَنَة (al-maymanah) derives from يُمْن (yumn), meaning "right side," "blessing," or "good fortune."
- **أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ** (aṣḥāb al-mash'amah): "Companions of the left." The term المَشْأَمَة (al-mash'amah) comes from شُؤم (shu'm), meaning "left side," "ill-omened," or "misfortune."
- **السَّابِقُونَ** (as-sābiqūn): "The foremost." This word derives from سَبَقَ (sabaqa), meaning "to precede" or "to outstrip," referring to those who excel in faith and good deeds.

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir notes that the repetition in these verses ("what are the companions of the right?" and "the foremost - they are the foremost") indicates emphasis and magnification of the status of these groups. The interrogative form is used to draw attention to their significance and to create anticipation for their description.

Al-Qurtubi mentions that the division into three categories represents the final sorting of humanity on the Day of Judgment, when all pretense will be removed and people will be judged solely on their faith and deeds.

Contemporary scholar Sayyid Qutb observes that this tripartite division is more nuanced than the binary division (believers vs. disbelievers) found in many other surahs, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of human spiritual achievement.

### Verses 11-26: The Foremost (As-Sabiqun)

**Arabic:**
```
أُولَٰئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ ﴿١١﴾ فِي جَنَّاتِ النَّعِيمِ ﴿١٢﴾ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الْأَوَّلِينَ ﴿١٣﴾ وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الْآخِرِينَ ﴿١٤﴾ عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ ﴿١٥﴾ مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَابِلِينَ ﴿١٦﴾ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَانٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ ﴿١٧﴾ بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ ﴿١٨﴾ لَّا يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلَا يُنزِفُونَ ﴿١٩﴾ وَفَاكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ ﴿٢٠﴾ وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ ﴿٢١﴾ وَحُورٌ عِينٌ ﴿٢٢﴾ كَأَمْثَالِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ ﴿٢٣﴾ جَزَاءً بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ ﴿٢٤﴾ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا وَلَا تَأْثِيمًا ﴿٢٥﴾ إِلَّا قِيلًا سَلَامًا سَلَامًا ﴿٢٦﴾
```

**Translation:**
"Those are the ones brought near [to Allah] in Gardens of Pleasure, a [large] company of the former peoples and a few of the later peoples, on thrones woven [with ornament], reclining on them, facing each other. There will circulate among them young boys made eternal with vessels, pitchers and a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring - no headache will they have therefrom, nor will they be intoxicated - and fruit of what they select and the meat of fowl, from whatever they desire. And [for them are] fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes, the likenesses of pearls well-protected, as reward for what they used to do. They will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin - only a saying: 'Peace, peace.'"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **الْمُقَرَّبُونَ** (al-muqarrabūn): "Those brought near." This term derives from قَرُبَ (qaruba), "to be near," with the intensive form indicating those specially chosen to be in proximity to Allah.
- **جَنَّاتِ النَّعِيمِ** (jannāt an-na'īm): "Gardens of Pleasure/Delight." The term نَعِيم (na'īm) conveys the idea of bliss, luxury, and comfort.
- **سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ** (sururin mawḍūnah): "Thrones woven [with ornament]." The term مَوْضُونَة (mawḍūnah) comes from وَضَنَ (waḍana), referring to the intricate weaving or inlaying of precious metals and gems.
- **حُورٌ عِينٌ** (ḥūrun 'īn): "Fair women with large, beautiful eyes." حُور (ḥūr) refers to the intense whiteness and purity of the eye, while عِين ('īn) refers to the large, beautiful nature of the eyes.

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Abbas said that "the foremost" refers to those who hastened to accept Islam and to migrate for the sake of Allah in the early days of Islam. Many scholars also include in this category the prophets and the most sincere believers of all times.

Al-Tabari notes that the phrase "a large company of the former peoples and a few of the later peoples" (verses 13-14) indicates that the highest rank of Paradise contains more people from earlier generations than from later ones, possibly because true faith becomes harder to maintain as time passes.

Contemporary scholar Mohammad Asad points out that these descriptions of Paradise, while including physical pleasures, also emphasize the spiritual aspects such as peace (سَلَام salām) and the absence of idle talk (لَغْو laghw) and sinful speech (تَأْثِيم ta'thīm).

### Verses 27-40: The Companions of the Right (Ashab Al-Yamin)

**Arabic:**
```
وَأَصْحَابُ الْيَمِينِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْيَمِينِ ﴿٢٧﴾ فِي سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ ﴿٢٨﴾ وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ ﴿٢٩﴾ وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ ﴿٣٠﴾ وَمَاءٍ مَّسْكُوبٍ ﴿٣١﴾ وَفَاكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ ﴿٣٢﴾ لَّا مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلَا مَمْنُوعَةٍ ﴿٣٣﴾ وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ ﴿٣٤﴾ إِنَّا أَنشَأْنَاهُنَّ إِنشَاءً ﴿٣٥﴾ فَجَعَلْنَاهُنَّ أَبْكَارًا ﴿٣٦﴾ عُرُبًا أَتْرَابًا ﴿٣٧﴾ لِّأَصْحَابِ الْيَمِينِ ﴿٣٨﴾ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الْأَوَّلِينَ ﴿٣٩﴾ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الْآخِرِينَ ﴿٤٠﴾
```

**Translation:**
"And the companions of the right - what are the companions of the right? [They will be] among lote-trees with thorns removed and [banana] trees layered [with fruit] and shade extended and water poured out and fruit, abundant [and varied], neither limited [to season] nor forbidden, and [upon] beds raised high. Indeed, We have produced them in a [new] creation and made them virgins, devoted [to their husbands] and of equal age, for the companions of the right [who are] a company of the former peoples and a company of the later peoples."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ** (sidrin makhḍūd): "Lote-trees with thorns removed." The term مَخْضُود (makhḍūd) comes from خَضَدَ (khaḍada), meaning "to remove thorns" or "to make thornless," symbolizing comfort without irritation.
- **طَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ** (ṭalḥin manḍūd): Most commentators interpret طَلْح (ṭalḥ) as banana trees, while مَنضُود (manḍūd) means "layered" or "arranged in order," indicating abundant fruit.
- **ظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ** (ẓillin mamdūd): "Extended shade." The term مَمْدُود (mamdūd) comes from مَدَّ (madda), meaning "to extend" or "to stretch out," suggesting constant, uninterrupted shade.
- **عُرُبًا أَتْرَابًا** ('uruban atrāban): "Devoted [to their husbands] and of equal age." عُرُب ('urub) are women who express love and devotion to their husbands, while أَتْرَاب (atrāb) means "of equal age."

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir explains that the companions of the right are the general body of believers who fulfilled their obligations to Allah but did not reach the extraordinary level of the foremost.

Al-Qurtubi notes that while both the foremost and the companions of the right enter Paradise, the companions of the right are mentioned to have blessings that are different from those of the foremost. This suggests a hierarchy in Paradise based on one's deeds.

Contemporary scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani points out that the phrase "a company of the former peoples and a company of the later peoples" (verses 39-40) indicates that, unlike the foremost, the companions of the right will be numerous in both earlier and later generations.

### Verses 41-56: The Companions of the Left (Ashab Al-Shimal)

**Arabic:**
```
وَأَصْحَابُ الشِّمَالِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الشِّمَالِ ﴿٤١﴾ فِي سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ ﴿٤٢﴾ وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ ﴿٤٣﴾ لَّا بَارِدٍ وَلَا كَرِيمٍ ﴿٤٤﴾ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا قَبْلَ ذَٰلِكَ مُتْرَفِينَ ﴿٤٥﴾ وَكَانُوا يُصِرُّونَ عَلَى الْحِنثِ الْعَظِيمِ ﴿٤٦﴾ وَكَانُوا يَ
