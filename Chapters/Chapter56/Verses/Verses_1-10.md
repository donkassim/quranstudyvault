# Surah Al-Waqiah (The Inevitable Event) - Verses 1-10

## Introduction

The opening section of Surah Al-Waqiah (verses 1-10) introduces the Day of Judgment with dramatic imagery and establishes the three fundamental categories into which humanity will be divided. This powerful beginning sets the stage for the entire surah's discourse on the afterlife, accountability, and divine justice.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1: إِذَا وَقَعَتِ الْوَاقِعَةُ
**Transliteration:** *Idha waqa'atil waqi'ah*  
**Translation:** *"When the Event (of Judgment) occurs"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- The verse begins with **إِذَا** (idha), a conditional particle meaning "when" rather than "if," emphasizing certainty
- **وَقَعَتِ** (waqa'at) is a past tense verb from the root و-ق-ع (w-q-'), meaning "to occur" or "to befall"
- **الْوَاقِعَةُ** (al-waqi'ah) is a noun from the same root, creating an emphatic cognate accusative structure
- This construction emphasizes the definitive nature of this event; it is not a possibility but an inevitability

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Ibn Kathir notes that Al-Waqi'ah (The Event) is one of the names of the Day of Judgment, describing it as certain to occur
- Al-Tabari explains that the verse establishes the premise upon which the rest of the surah builds: the certainty of judgment
- The use of the past tense for a future event (waqa'at) is a rhetorical device in Arabic that conveys absolute certainty

#### Thematic Connections:
- The opening mirrors other surahs that begin with eschatological themes (e.g., Al-Qari'ah, Al-Takwir)
- The immediacy created by beginning with "when" draws the listener directly into the scene of judgment
- This verse establishes the central theme of inevitability that runs throughout the surah

### Verse 2: لَيْسَ لِوَقْعَتِهَا كَاذِبَةٌ
**Transliteration:** *Laysa liwaq'atiha kadhibah*  
**Translation:** *"There is no denying its occurrence"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- **لَيْسَ** (laysa) is a negative particle meaning "there is not" or "there does not exist"
- **لِوَقْعَتِهَا** (liwaq'atiha) consists of the preposition **لِ** (li, "for"), the noun **وَقْعَة** (waq'ah, "occurrence") and the suffix **هَا** (ha, "its")
- **كَاذِبَةٌ** (kadhibah) derives from the root ك-ذ-ب (k-dh-b) meaning "falsehood" or "denial"
- The grammatical structure negates any possibility of falsehood concerning this event

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Al-Qurtubi interprets this verse as stating that no soul can deny or belie the reality of this event when it occurs
- Al-Razi explains that this is both a statement about the event's certainty and a refutation of those who deny resurrection
- Some commentators understand "kadhibah" as referring to the impossibility of turning back or averting this event

#### Thematic Connections:
- This verse reinforces the theme of accountability, emphasizing that denial will not be possible at that time
- It serves as a response to the disbelievers mentioned throughout the Quran who doubt resurrection
- The emphasis on truth versus falsehood creates a binary foundation for the three-fold categorization that follows

### Verse 3: خَافِضَةٌ رَّافِعَةٌ
**Transliteration:** *Khafidatur-rafi'ah*  
**Translation:** *"It will bring down (some) and raise up (others)"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- **خَافِضَةٌ** (khafidah) is an active participle from the root خ-ف-ض (kh-f-d), meaning "to lower" or "to bring down"
- **رَّافِعَةٌ** (rafi'ah) is an active participle from the root ر-ف-ع (r-f-'), meaning "to raise" or "to elevate"
- The juxtaposition of these two contrasting terms creates a powerful antithesis
- Both terms are indefinite and in the nominative case, serving as descriptors of Al-Waqi'ah from verse 1

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Ibn Abbas explains this verse as referring to how the Day will lower the status of disbelievers and elevate believers
- Al-Zamakhshari notes the verse illustrates the complete reversal of worldly status that will occur
- Some commentators connect this to the physical upheaval of the earth and mountains mentioned in other accounts of the Day of Judgment

#### Thematic Connections:
- This verse introduces the theme of reversal of fortunes that appears throughout the Quran
- It foreshadows the three categories of people that will be detailed in verses 7-10
- The contrasting motion (down/up) establishes a spatial metaphor for moral and spiritual status that continues throughout the surah

### Verse 4: إِذَا رُجَّتِ الْأَرْضُ رَجًّا
**Transliteration:** *Idha rujjat al-ardu rajja*  
**Translation:** *"When the earth is shaken with a (severe) shaking"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- Again beginning with **إِذَا** (idha, "when"), maintaining the certainty established in verse 1
- **رُجَّتِ** (rujjat) is a passive verb from the root ر-ج-ج (r-j-j), meaning "to shake violently"
- **الْأَرْضُ** (al-ardu) means "the earth" and is the subject of the passive verb
- **رَجًّا** (rajja) is a verbal noun from the same root, creating an emphatic cognate accusative structure similar to verse 1

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Mujahid described this shaking as more violent than the strongest earthquake imaginable
- Al-Tabari connects this verse to others describing the earth's condition on the Day of Judgment, such as in Surah Al-Zilzal
- The repeated root emphasizes the thoroughness and intensity of the earth's convulsion

#### Thematic Connections:
- This verse begins a section (verses 4-6) describing cosmic disturbances that signal the Day of Judgment
- The physical upheaval of the earth parallels the social/spiritual upheaval mentioned in verse 3
- The imagery connects to other Quranic passages about earth-shaking events (e.g., Al-Zilzal, Al-Haqqah)

### Verse 5: وَبُسَّتِ الْجِبَالُ بَسًّا
**Transliteration:** *Wa bussat al-jibalu bassa*  
**Translation:** *"And the mountains are crushed with a (complete) crushing"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- **وَ** (wa) is the conjunction "and," continuing the sequence of events
- **بُسَّتِ** (bussat) is a passive verb from the root ب-س-س (b-s-s), meaning "to crush" or "to pulverize"
- **الْجِبَالُ** (al-jibalu) means "the mountains" and is the subject of the passive verb
- **بَسًّا** (bassa) is the verbal noun from the same root, again creating an emphatic cognate accusative structure

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Ibn Kathir describes this as mountains being crushed to dust after being uprooted
- Al-Qurtubi relates this to other Quranic descriptions of mountains becoming like carded wool or scattered dust
- The passive voice emphasizes that mountains, despite their apparent strength and permanence, will be acted upon by divine power

#### Thematic Connections:
- Mountains in the Quran often symbolize stability and permanence; their destruction represents complete disruption of the natural order
- This continues the theme of cosmic upheaval started in verse 4
- The pulverization of mountains connects to the theme of pride's destruction, as mountains are sometimes metaphors for human arrogance

### Verse 6: فَكَانَتْ هَبَاءً مُّنبَثًّا
**Transliteration:** *Fakanat haba'am munbaththa*  
**Translation:** *"And become scattered dust"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- **فَ** (fa) is a consequential conjunction meaning "then" or "so"
- **كَانَتْ** (kanat) is the feminine past tense verb "became," referring to the mountains
- **هَبَاءً** (haba'an) means "dust" or "particles" and derives from a root describing what is seen in a shaft of light
- **مُّنبَثًّا** (munbaththa) is a passive participle meaning "scattered" or "dispersed" from the root ب-ث-ث (b-th-th)

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Al-Razi explains that "haba'" refers to the minute particles visible in a ray of sunlight, emphasizing the complete disintegration
- Mujahid described the term as referring to the dust that rises and then falls to the ground, without cohesion
- This verse completes the image of total destruction—from solid mountains to floating dust particles

#### Thematic Connections:
- This imagery of mountains turning to scattered dust appears in other eschatological passages (e.g., Surah Al-Waqi'ah, Al-Mursalat)
- The contrast between the mountains' former solidity and their eventual state as scattered particles underscores divine power
- This verse concludes the cosmic upheaval section and transitions to the categorization of people

### Verse 7: وَكُنتُمْ أَزْوَاجًا ثَلَاثَةً
**Transliteration:** *Wa kuntum azwajan thalathah*  
**Translation:** *"And you will be (sorted into) three categories"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- **وَ** (wa) is the conjunction "and," shifting focus from cosmic events to human categorization
- **كُنتُمْ** (kuntum) is the past tense plural "you were/became," using the past tense for a future event to emphasize certainty
- **أَزْوَاجًا** (azwajan) literally means "pairs" or "types," derived from the root ز-و-ج (z-w-j)
- **ثَلَاثَةً** (thalathah) is the numeral "three," establishing the tripartite division that follows

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Ibn Kathir notes that this three-fold division is unique to Surah Al-Waqi'ah, as most other Quranic passages divide humanity into two groups
- Al-Tabari explains that the term "azwaj" (pairs/types) indicates each category has distinctive characteristics
- This verse establishes one of the most distinctive features of Surah Al-Waqi'ah: its tripartite eschatological framework

#### Thematic Connections:
- This verse marks a transition from describing cosmic events to focusing on human categorization and destiny
- The three-fold division offers a more nuanced view than the binary division (believers/disbelievers) found in many other surahs
- This categorization becomes the organizing principle for the remainder of the surah

### Verse 8: فَأَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ
**Transliteration:** *Fa'as-haabul maymanati maa as-haabul maymanah*  
**Translation:** *"Then the Companions of the Right Hand – what are the Companions of the Right Hand?"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- **فَ** (fa) is a consequential conjunction "then" or "so," beginning the elaboration of the three categories
- **أَصْحَابُ** (as-haab) means "companions" or "people of" from the root ص-ح-ب (s-h-b)
- **الْمَيْمَنَةِ** (al-maymanah) derives from the root ي-م-ن (y-m-n) associated with "right side," "blessing," and "good fortune"
- **مَا** (maa) is an interrogative particle expressing wonder or magnification, not actually seeking information
- The repetition of "as-haabul maymanah" creates emphasis and suspense

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Al-Qurtubi explains that they are called companions of the right because they will receive their records in their right hands
- Other commentators connect this to Quranic passages stating the righteous will be on Allah's "right side" on the Day of Judgment
- The interrogative structure is understood as expressing the greatness of their status and condition

#### Thematic Connections:
- This is the first of the three categories introduced in verse 7
- The term "maymanah" connects to the concept of "yumn" (blessing), foreshadowing their blessed state
- The rhetorical question creates anticipation for the full description of this group that comes later in the surah

### Verse 9: وَأَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ
**Transliteration:** *Wa as-haabul mash'amati maa as-haabul mash'amah*  
**Translation:** *"And the Companions of the Left Hand – what are the Companions of the Left Hand?"*

#### Linguistic Analysis:
- **وَ** (wa) is the conjunction "and," continuing the categorization
- **أَصْحَابُ** (as-haab) again means "companions" or "people of"
- **الْمَشْأَمَةِ** (al-mash'amah) derives from the root ش-أ-م (sh-'-m) associated with "left side," "ill-omen," and "misfortune"
- **مَا** (maa) again functions as an interrogative particle expressing wonder or magnification
- The structure precisely parallels verse 8, creating a balanced contrast

#### Tafsir Insights:
- Ibn Abbas explains that they are called companions of the left because they will receive their records in their left hands
- Al-Razi connects the term "mash'amah" to the concept of "shu'm" (ill-fortune or misfortune)
- Some commentators note this group corresponds to the "lowered" mentioned in verse 3

#### Thematic Connections:
- This is the second of the three categories and stands in direct contrast to the first
- The parallel structure with verse 8 emphasizes the binary opposition between these two groups
- The term "mash'amah" foreshadows their misfortunate state described later in the surah

### Verse 10: وَالسَّابِقُونَ السَّابِقُونَ
**Transliteration:** *Was-saabiquunas-saabiquun*  
**Translation:** *"And those Foremost (in faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter)"*
