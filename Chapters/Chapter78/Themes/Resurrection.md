# Resurrection in Surah An-Naba (Chapter 78)

## Introduction
Resurrection (al-Ba'th) is one of the central themes in Surah An-Naba (The Great News), with the chapter deriving its name from the "great news" which refers to the Day of Resurrection. This theme is foundational to Islamic eschatology and serves as a cornerstone of faith, emphasizing accountability and divine justice.

## Presentation of Resurrection in Surah An-Naba

### The Great News
The surah begins by immediately drawing attention to resurrection, framing it as "the great news" about which people are in disagreement:

> "About what are they asking one another? About the great news - That over which they are in disagreement." (Verses 1-3)

This opening establishes resurrection as the central subject matter of the chapter. The Quran identifies resurrection as a matter of dispute among disbelievers, highlighting its significance as a dividing theological concept.

### Cosmic Signs and Divine Power
The surah proceeds to provide evidence for the possibility of resurrection by pointing to Allah's creation of the universe and earth:

> "Have We not made the earth as a bed, And the mountains as pegs, And created you in pairs, And made your sleep for rest, And made the night as a covering, And made the day for livelihood, And built above you seven strong [heavens], And made [therein] a burning lamp, And sent down, from the rain clouds, pouring water?" (Verses 6-14)

This passage demonstrates Allah's power to create and organize the universe, implying that the One who created life initially certainly has the power to restore it after death.

### The Day of Judgment as a Fixed Time
The surah explicitly mentions the Day of Judgment as an appointed time:

> "Indeed, the Day of Judgment is an appointed time - The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes" (Verses 17-18)

This establishes resurrection as a definite future event, scheduled and unavoidable.

### Physical Descriptions of Resurrection
The surah provides vivid imagery of cosmic disruption that will accompany resurrection:

> "And the heaven is opened and will become gateways, And the mountains are removed and will be [but] a mirage." (Verses 19-20)

These verses depict the dramatic physical transformation of the universe, emphasizing the magnitude of this event.

## Key Verses on Resurrection

### Verses 1-5: The Great News
> "About what are they asking one another? About the great news - That over which they are in disagreement. No! They are going to know. Then, no! They are going to know."

These verses establish resurrection as "the great news" and affirm that deniers will ultimately be confronted with its reality.

### Verses 17-20: The Appointed Day
> "Indeed, the Day of Judgment is an appointed time - The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes, And the heaven is opened and will become gateways, And the mountains are removed and will be [but] a mirage."

These verses describe the dramatic events that will mark the beginning of resurrection and judgment.

### Verses 21-30: Hell as a Destination
> "Indeed, Hell has been lying in wait For the transgressors, a place of return, In which they will remain for ages [unending]. They will not taste therein [any] coolness or drink Except scalding water and [foul] purulence - An appropriate recompense."

These verses describe the consequences for those who denied resurrection, emphasizing the reality and justice of divine punishment.

### Verses 31-36: Paradise as a Reward
> "Indeed, for the righteous is attainment - Gardens and grapevines And full-breasted [companions] of equal age And a full cup. No ill speech will they hear therein or any falsehood - [As] reward from your Lord, [a generous] gift [made due by] account."

These verses describe the rewards of paradise, highlighting the fulfillment of divine promises for the believers who affirmed resurrection.

### Verses 38-40: The Day of Standing
> "The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows, they will not speak except for one whom the Most Merciful permits, and he will say what is correct. That is the True Day; so he who wills may take to his Lord a [way of] return. Indeed, We have warned you of a near punishment on the Day when a man will observe what his hands have put forth and the disbeliever will say, 'Oh, I wish that I were dust!'"

These verses emphasize the seriousness and inevitability of the Day of Judgment, where each person will be held accountable for their deeds.

## Theological Significance of Resurrection in Islam

### Foundation of Accountability
The concept of resurrection in Surah An-Naba reinforces the Islamic principle of ultimate accountability. Every action in this world carries consequences in the afterlife, encouraging ethical behavior and moral responsibility.

### Divine Justice
Resurrection ensures that justice is served ultimately, even if not immediately in this world. The detailed descriptions of paradise and hell emphasize that no deed, good or bad, goes without appropriate recompense.

### Motivation for Faith and Righteous Conduct
The vivid descriptions of both reward and punishment serve as powerful motivators for believers to maintain faith and perform good deeds, while warning disbelievers of the consequences of denial.

### Completion of Divine Purpose
Resurrection represents the culmination of Allah's plan for humanity. The temporary nature of worldly life finds its meaning and purpose in the eternal life to come, where the ultimate consequences of choices made in this life are realized.

### Demonstration of Divine Power
The ability to resurrect the dead is presented as a supreme demonstration of Allah's omnipotence. The One who created life from nothing can certainly restore it after death.

## Conclusion
In Surah An-Naba, resurrection is not merely presented as a theological concept but as "the great news" that forms the foundation of accountability in Islamic belief. The surah uses powerful imagery and logical arguments to establish its inevitability, emphasizing divine power, justice, and the ultimate fulfillment of Allah's promises and warnings.
