## Commentary

### Context
Surah An-Naba was revealed in Mecca during a period when the Quraysh and other disbelievers were in denial about the resurrection and the Day of Judgment. The surah addresses their skepticism directly by referring to their discussions and disputes about these matters as "the great news."

### Verse 1-3: Introducing the Great News
The opening begins with a rhetorical question that immediately captures attention. Instead of directly stating the topic, Allah poses a question about what people are questioning among themselves. This literary device creates suspense and draws the listener/reader in.

The "great news" (النبإ العظيم) refers to the resurrection and the Day of Judgment - the most momentous event that awaits humanity. This news is described as "great" because:
- It concerns every human being
- It is inevitable and cannot be averted
- Its consequences are eternal

The people of Mecca were divided concerning this news:
- The believers accepted it as truth
- The disbelievers rejected it as impossible
- Some were skeptical and uncertain

### Verses 4-5: Warning and Emphasis
These verses constitute a powerful response to the denial and skepticism. The repetition of "كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ" (No! They are going to know) serves multiple purposes:
- It emphasizes the certainty of the coming knowledge
- It indicates a warning and threat
- The repetition with "ثُمَّ" (then) suggests escalation or layers of realization

The use of the future tense "سَيَعْلَمُونَ" (they will know) indicates that this knowledge is inevitable but hasn't yet come to them. This conveys that denial is temporary, and the truth will eventually become evident to all - either in this world or the next.

The repetition in verse 5 with the addition of "ثُمَّ" (then) intensifies the warning, suggesting that this knowledge will come in stages or that the realization will be increasingly profound.

## Reflection Points

1. **The Gravity of Denial**: Why does Allah open this surah by addressing people's questioning and denial rather than simply stating the truth?

2. **The Great News**: What makes the resurrection and Day of Judgment the "greatest news" that humanity can receive? How should this recognition impact our daily choices?

3. **The Nature of Disagreement**: What causes people to disagree about fundamental truths despite being presented with the same evidence? How does this relate to our own times?

4. **The Warning**: The emphatic repetition of "they will know" serves as both a warning and a promise. How does this dual nature of Allah's message demonstrate both justice and mercy?

5. **Certainty vs. Doubt**: How does certainty about the Hereafter transform one's perspective on worldly life? What practical changes might this certainty inspire?
