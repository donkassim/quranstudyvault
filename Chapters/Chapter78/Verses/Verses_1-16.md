# Surah An-Naba (78) - Verses 1-16: The Great News and Signs of Divine Power

## Introduction to This Section

Verses 1-16 of Surah An-Naba form the opening section of this powerful Makkan surah. These verses introduce "The Great News" (النبأ العظيم) - a reference to the Day of Resurrection that the disbelievers questioned - and then present a series of natural phenomena as undeniable signs of Allah's power and ability to resurrect. The section establishes a foundational argument: the One who created these magnificent aspects of our world can certainly resurrect humanity for judgment.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verses 1-5: Introduction to the Great News

**Verse 1-2**
> عَمَّ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ ﴿١﴾ عَنِ ٱلنَّبَإِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ
> "About what are they asking one another? About the great news"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `عَمَّ` (ʿamma) - A contraction of `عَنْ مَا` (ʿan mā) meaning "about what"
- `يَتَسَآءَلُونَ` (yatasā'alūn) - Present tense verb in Form VI, indicating mutual questioning among people
- `النَّبَإِ` (al-naba') - News of great importance; not merely `خبر` (khabar) which refers to ordinary news
- `العَظِيمِ` (al-ʿaẓīm) - Tremendous, mighty, emphasizing the gravity of this news

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir notes that this opening uses a rhetorical technique called استفهام (istifhām, questioning) to create curiosity and draw attention to the subject. The "great news" refers to the resurrection and Day of Judgment that the Quraysh often debated and denied. The interrogative style mirrors the skeptical questioning of the disbelievers while simultaneously challenging their denial.

Az-Zamakhshari adds that beginning with a question elevates the importance of what follows and prepares the listener for significant information.

**Thematic Connections:**
Similar questioning introductions appear in Surah Al-Ghashiyah (88:1) and Surah Al-Qari'ah (101:1-3), establishing a pattern for introducing eschatological themes. The term "naba'" (news) occurs in similar contexts in Surah Sad (38:67) and Surah Ibrahim (14:9).

**Reflection:**
Consider how questions can be more powerful than direct statements in capturing attention and provoking thought. The Quran's rhetorical question invites both believer and disbeliever to contemplate this "great news."

**Verse 3-4**
> ٱلَّذِى هُمْ فِيهِ مُخْتَلِفُونَ ﴿٣﴾ كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ
> "That over which they are in disagreement. No! They are going to know."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `مُخْتَلِفُونَ` (mukhtalifūn) - Active participle in Form VIII from the root خ-ل-ف (kh-l-f), indicating ongoing disagreement
- `كَلَّا` (kallā) - Emphatic negation/rebuke, indicating strong refutation of their denial
- `سَيَعْلَمُونَ` (sa-yaʿlamūn) - Future tense with the prefix سَـ (sa-) indicating near future; "they will soon know"

**Tafsir Insights:**
Al-Qurtubi explains that people differed concerning the resurrection - some affirmed it while others denied it completely. The rebuke with "kallā" serves as a decisive response to this disagreement. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ encountered fierce opposition from Meccan polytheists specifically on the issue of resurrection.

At-Tabari notes that "sa-yaʿlamūn" carries a warning - their knowledge will come through witnessing the reality of what they denied, but too late to benefit them.

**Thematic Connections:**
This pattern of disagreement followed by definitive warning appears throughout the Quran when discussing resurrection, as in Surah Maryam (19:37-38) and Surah Mursalat (77:12-15). The assurance of future knowledge contrasts their current state of heedlessness.

**Reflection:**
How often do people argue about matters of faith without sufficient knowledge? These verses suggest that certainty will eventually come to all, but for some, it will be too late to benefit from this knowledge.

**Verse 5**
> ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ
> "Then, no! They are going to know."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `ثُمَّ` (thumma) - Conjunction indicating sequence and escalation
- The repetition of `كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ` (kallā sa-yaʿlamūn) - Emphasizes the certainty and gravity of their future knowledge

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn 'Ashur observes that this repetition serves to emphasize and intensify the warning. Some mufassirūn suggest the first instance refers to knowledge upon death, while the second refers to knowledge on the Day of Resurrection - thus representing escalating levels of certainty.

The repetition employs the rhetorical device of تكرار (takrār) which the Quran uses to emphasize critical points.

**Thematic Connections:**
Similar repetition for emphasis occurs in Surah At-Takathur (102:3-4) with "kallā sawfa taʿlamūn" repeated to emphasize the consequences of worldly distraction.

**Reflection:**
Consider the psychological impact of repetition in warnings. The doubled warning in this verse leaves no room for doubt about the seriousness of the message and the certainty of its fulfillment.

### Verses 6-16: Natural Signs of Allah's Power

**Verse 6-7**
> أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ ٱلْأَرْضَ مِهَٰدًا ﴿٦﴾ وَٱلْجِبَالَ أَوْتَادًا
> "Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes?"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `أَلَمْ` (alam) - Interrogative with negative particle, creating a rhetorical question expecting affirmation
- `مِهَادًا` (mihādan) - From م-ه-د (m-h-d), meaning a bed, cradle, or something spread out for comfort
- `أَوْتَادًا` (awtādan) - Plural of وَتَد (watad), meaning pegs or stakes that secure a tent

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ar-Razi explains that after establishing the reality of resurrection, Allah presents evidence of His power through creation. The earth as "mihād" is perfectly suited for human habitation - neither too hard nor too soft, neither too hot nor too cold.

Ibn Kathir notes that mountains function like tent stakes (awtād), stabilizing the earth's crust. This metaphor would have been immediately understood by the desert-dwelling Arabs familiar with securing tents against strong winds.

Modern scientific understanding confirms that mountains have deep roots extending into the earth's crust, providing stability similar to how stakes secure a tent - a remarkable geological insight in the Quran.

**Thematic Connections:**
Similar references to the earth and mountains appear in Surah An-Nazi'at (79:32-33), Surah Al-Ghashiyah (88:19), and Surah Luqman (31:10). These natural phenomena are consistently presented as signs of Allah's creative power and design.

**Reflection:**
Consider how everyday aspects of our environment that we take for granted are actually precisely calibrated divine gifts. The earth's suitability for life and the stabilizing function of mountains represent intelligent design rather than random chance.

**Verse 8**
> وَخَلَقْنَٰكُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا
> "And We created you in pairs"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `خَلَقْنَاكُمْ` (khalaqnākum) - "We created you" with the plural pronoun indicating divine majesty
- `أَزْوَاجًا` (azwājan) - Plural of زَوْج (zawj), meaning pairs, couples, or spouses

**Tafsir Insights:**
Al-Qurtubi explains that this refers to the male and female complementarity essential to human procreation and continuity. This pairing exists not just in humans but throughout creation, in animals and even plants.

Az-Zamakhshari notes that the shift from cosmic signs (earth, mountains) to human creation draws attention to the miracle that exists within our own being.

This verse establishes that duality and complementarity are intrinsic to Allah's creation design, a principle now recognized in modern biology as foundational to life's continuation.

**Thematic Connections:**
The theme of creation in pairs appears in Surah Adh-Dhariyat (51:49), "And of all things We created pairs," extending this principle beyond humans to the entire creation. Surah Ya-Sin (36:36) mentions the pairs in plants, humans, and things unknown to us.

**Reflection:**
The complementary nature of creation invites reflection on how opposites often work together in harmony. Consider how the principle of pairs extends beyond gender to various aspects of life, including the physical and the spiritual.

**Verse 9**
> وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا
> "And We made your sleep [a means for] rest"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `نَوْمَكُمْ` (nawmakum) - "Your sleep" from the root ن-و-م (n-w-m)
- `سُبَاتًا` (subātan) - From س-ب-ت (s-b-t), indicating cessation of activity, rest, or recuperation

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn 'Abbas explains that subātan means your bodies rest through sleep. Modern neuroscience confirms sleep's essential role in physical restoration, memory consolidation, and psychological well-being.

Al-Alusi points out that the unconscious nature of sleep, where the person loses voluntary control yet the body continues its vital functions, is a daily "minor death" that foreshadows resurrection - each morning is a "mini-resurrection."

**Thematic Connections:**
The Quran connects sleep and death in Surah Az-Zumar (39:42), describing how Allah takes souls during sleep and death. Surah Al-Furqan (25:47) similarly describes sleep as "death" and awakening as "nushūr" (resurrection).

**Reflection:**
Consider how the daily cycle of sleeping and waking serves as a tangible reminder of death and resurrection. This universal human experience offers an accessible metaphor for understanding the greater resurrection to come.

**Verse 10**
> وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلَّيْلَ لِبَاسًا
> "And We made the night as clothing"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `اللَّيْلَ` (al-layl) - "The night" from the root ل-ي-ل (l-y-l)
- `لِبَاسًا` (libāsan) - "Clothing" or "covering" from the root ل-ب-س (l-b-s)

**Tafsir Insights:**
Mujahid and Qatadah explain that night covers the earth with darkness just as clothing covers the body. This beautiful metaphor conveys how night provides privacy, comfort, and concealment.

Al-Baydawi notes that just as clothing protects from external elements, night's darkness shields people from visual disturbances and creates conditions conducive to rest.

**Thematic Connections:**
This metaphor appears similarly in Surah Al-Furqan (25:47) and Surah Al-A'raf (7:189) where night and intimate relations are both described using the concept of "covering." The alternation of night and day as signs appears frequently in the Quran, including Surah Al-Imran (3:190).

**Reflection:**
Consider the wisdom in the natural cycle of light and darkness. Night's "clothing" provides necessary contrast to day's activity, creating a rhythm essential for all life. How might modern light pollution disrupt this divine design?

**Verse 11**
> وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلنَّهَارَ مَعَاشًا
> "And We made the day for livelihood"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `النَّهَارَ` (al-nahār) - "The day" from the root ن-ه-ر (n-h-r)
- `مَعَاشًا` (ma'āshan) - "Livelihood" or "means of living" from the root ع-ي-ش ('a-y-sh)

**Tafsir Insights:**
At-Tabari explains that ma'āshan means the time when people disperse to seek their livelihood and attend to their needs. The light of day enables work, travel, and sustenance-seeking activities.

Ibn Kathir notes the perfect complementarity between night for rest (verse 10) and day for work (verse 11), creating a balanced cycle supporting both physical needs and economic activities.

**Thematic Connections:**
This functional distinction between night and day is mentioned in Surah Al-Isra (17:12) where the day is described as "mubsirah" (sight-giving) to seek bounty. Surah Al-Qasas (28:73) asks who other than Allah could bring a perpetual day without night for rest, emphasizing this essential alternation.

**Reflection:**
Consider how the natural cycle of day and night establishes a rhythm that structures all human societies across cultures and time. This divinely ordained pattern suggests the importance of balancing work and rest, activity and recovery.

**Verse 12-13**
> وَبَنَيْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعًا شِدَادًا ﴿١٢﴾ وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا
> "And We built above you seven strong [heavens], And made [therein] a burning lamp"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `بَنَيْنَا` (banaynā) - "We built" from the root ب-ن-ي (b-n-y), conveying careful construction
- `سَبْعًا شِدَادًا` (sab'an shidādan) - "Seven strong ones," with شِدَاد (shidād) emphasizing strength and firmness
- `سِرَاجًا` (sirājan) - "Lamp" from س-ر-ج (s-r-j), referring to the sun
- `وَهَّاجًا` (wahhājan) - "Burning intensely" from و-ه-ج (w-h-j), describing the sun's intense heat and light
**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Abbas and most commentators identify the "seven strong" as the seven heavens mentioned elsewhere in the Quran. "Shidād" (strong) describes their perfect construction and stability.

Az-Zamakhshari explains that the sun is called "sirāj" (lamp) because it provides both light and heat, just as an oil lamp does. The adjective "wahhāj" (intensely burning) emphasizes the sun's tremendous energy output and brightness that sustains life on earth.

Al-Qurtubi notes that the image of the heavens "built" above us emphasizes their architectural precision. Modern astronomy confirms the remarkable fine-tuning of our solar system and the universe's physical laws that make life possible.

**Thematic Connections:**
Similar descriptions of the heavens and celestial bodies appear in Surah Al-Mulk (67:3-5), which describes the heavens as "in layers" and adorned with lamps (stars). Surah Fussilat (41:12) also mentions the seven heavens and how Allah adorned the lowest heaven with stars.

**Reflection:**
Consider the astronomical precision required for the sun to support life on Earth – its distance, size, and energy output are all calibrated within narrow parameters. This "burning lamp" represents not random chance but purposeful design by a Creator who understands the needs of His creation.

**Verse 14-15**
> وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمُعْصِرَٰتِ مَآءً ثَجَّاجًا ﴿١٤﴾ لِّنُخْرِجَ بِهِۦ حَبًّا وَنَبَاتًا
> "And sent down, from the rain clouds, pouring water. That We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `الْمُعْصِرَات` (al-mu'ṣirāt) - Rain-bearing clouds, from the root ع-ص-ر ('a-ṣ-r) meaning to squeeze or press, as clouds "squeeze out" rain
- `ثَجَّاجًا` (thajjājan) - Abundantly pouring or gushing forth, from ث-ج-ج (th-j-j)
- `حَبًّا` (ḥabban) - Grains or cereals, from ح-ب-ب (ḥ-b-b)
- `نَبَاتًا` (nabātan) - Vegetation or plants in general, from ن-ب-ت (n-b-t)

**Tafsir Insights:**
Mujahid explains that al-mu'ṣirāt refers to winds that "press" the clouds to release rain. Other commentators, including Ibn 'Abbas, understand it as referring directly to the rain-laden clouds themselves.

Al-Alusi points out the profound hydrological cycle implied in these verses: water from the sky produces vegetation from the earth in a continuous cycle of provision. The verse shows the purposeful nature of rain – not merely as a physical phenomenon but as a means to sustain life through agriculture.

Ibn Kathir notes that Allah mentions basic human sustenance (grain, which forms staple foods) before general vegetation, emphasizing His provision of essential human needs.

**Thematic Connections:**
The life-giving nature of rainfall is highlighted in numerous Quranic passages, including Surah Qaf (50:9-11) and Surah Al-An'am (6:99). Surah Al-Hijr (15:22) describes the winds as "fertilizing," connecting to the concept of mu'ṣirāt in this verse.

**Reflection:**
Consider the intricate water cycle that sustains all life on Earth. From clouds to vegetation to food on our tables, this continuous process exemplifies both divine mercy and providence. How might deeper appreciation of this cycle impact our attitude toward water conservation and agricultural practices?

**Verse 16**
> وَجَنَّٰتٍ أَلْفَافًا
> "And gardens of thick foliage"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- `جَنَّات` (jannāt) - Gardens, from ج-ن-ن (j-n-n), referring to lush vegetation
- `أَلْفَافًا` (alfāfan) - Densely planted or thickly entangled, from ل-ف-ف (l-f-f), conveying abundance and lushness

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn 'Abbas explains that alfāfan means densely planted trees whose branches intertwine and overlap. This image conveys not just gardens but extraordinarily lush ones teeming with life and abundance.

At-Tabari notes that these gardens represent the height of agricultural beauty and bounty – a particularly powerful image for the desert-dwelling original audience of the Quran, for whom lush gardens represented the pinnacle of earthly prosperity.

**Thematic Connections:**
Gardens (jannāt) are consistently used throughout the Quran to represent both earthly bounty and paradise itself. Similar descriptions appear in Surah 'Abasa (80:27-32), which also moves from rain to vegetation to gardens. This establishes a connection between Allah's earthly blessings and the ultimate reward of Paradise.

**Reflection:**
Gardens of intertwining, abundant vegetation represent the culmination of Allah's life-sustaining systems on Earth. From a seemingly simple raindrop, intricate natural systems produce complex ecosystems that sustain countless species. These verses invite us to see beyond the physical phenomena to recognize the Creator's wisdom, power, and care in designing such interconnected systems.

## Synthesis and Broader Reflections

### Argumentation Method in These Verses

These sixteen verses follow a logical progression that establishes both the reality of resurrection and Allah's right to judge:

1. **Identifying the dispute** (verses 1-5): The "Great News" of resurrection is introduced as a matter of disagreement, with a firm warning to those who deny it.

2. **Presenting evidence** (verses 6-16): A series of signs in creation demonstrates Allah's power and wisdom:
   - Earth and mountains (structural foundation)
   - Human creation in pairs (biological foundation)
   - Sleep and the night/day cycle (temporal foundation)
   - Heavens and sun (cosmic foundation)
   - Rain and vegetation (sustenance foundation)

The argument is essentially: If Allah can create and sustain these complex, interconnected systems that we witness daily, how could He be unable to resurrect humanity for judgment?

### Thematic Coherence

Notice how the verses move systematically through different domains of creation:
- The ground beneath us (earth, mountains)
- Humanity itself (pairs)
- The cycle of our days (sleep, night, day)
- The cosmos above (heavens, sun)
- Life-sustaining provisions (rain, crops, gardens)

This comprehensive survey of creation leaves no room for doubting divine power and purpose.

### Personal Application

These verses invite us to:

1. **Observe creation mindfully**: Look at familiar aspects of nature with fresh eyes, recognizing them as divine signs
2. **Appreciate divine balance**: Notice the complementary pairs and cycles in creation
3. **Recognize purpose**: See the purposeful design in everything from rain to sleep
4. **Connect daily experiences to faith**: Use regular experiences like sleeping and waking as reminders of resurrection
5. **Express gratitude**: Acknowledge the numerous provisions Allah has arranged for human flourishing

### Questions for Further Reflection

1. How might regular contemplation of these natural phenomena strengthen faith in resurrection?
2. In what ways has modern science enhanced our appreciation of the precise design mentioned in these verses?
3. How does the Quran's approach of using observable phenomena differ from purely abstract theological arguments?
4. What personal habits might help us maintain awareness of these signs in our daily lives?
5. How do these verses challenge materialistic worldviews that see nature as random or purposeless?

The next section of Surah An-Naba (verses 17-30) will build upon this foundation by describing the Day of Judgment itself, the very reality these natural signs point toward.
