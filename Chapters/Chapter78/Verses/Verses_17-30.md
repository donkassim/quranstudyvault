## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 17: The Day of Sorting Out

**Arabic Text:**
إِنَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْفَصْلِ كَانَ مِيقَٰتًا

**Transliteration:**
Inna yawma-l-faṣli kāna mīqātan

**Translation:**
"Indeed, the Day of Judgment is an appointed time,"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **إِنَّ (inna)**: An emphatic particle that stresses the certainty of what follows.
- **يَوْمَ ٱلْفَصْلِ (yawma-l-faṣl)**: Literally "the Day of Sorting/Decision/Separation." The root (ف-ص-ل) conveys separation and distinction. This is a striking name for the Day of Judgment, highlighting its function of separating truth from falsehood and the righteous from the wrongdoers.
- **كَانَ (kāna)**: Past tense verb meaning "was" or "has been." Its use in this context emphasizes that this day has always been decreed in Allah's knowledge.
- **مِيقَٰتًا (mīqātan)**: An appointed time or fixed term. Derived from the root (و-ق-ت) related to timing and scheduling. This underscores that the Day of Judgment is not arbitrary but precisely determined by divine decree.

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir notes that this verse confirms the Day of Judgment is fixed in Allah's knowledge, neither advancing nor delaying from its appointed time. It represents the final junction where all of creation will be gathered for judgment.

Al-Qurtubi emphasizes that the use of "kāna" (was) indicates that this day has been predetermined in Allah's eternal knowledge, even though it has not yet occurred from our temporal perspective.

**Thematic Connections:**
This verse echoes similar statements about the fixed nature of the Day of Judgment in other surahs:
- "They ask you about the Hour, when is its arrival? Say, 'Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None will reveal its time except Him.'" (Surah Al-A'raf 7:187)
- "Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives." (Surah Ta-Ha 20:15)

### Verse 18: The Trumpet's Call

**Arabic Text:**
يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى ٱلصُّورِ فَتَأْتُونَ أَفْوَاجًا

**Transliteration:**
Yawma yunfakhu fī-ṣ-ṣūri fa-ta'tūna afwājan

**Translation:**
"The Day the Horn is blown, and you will come forth in multitudes."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **يُنفَخُ (yunfakhu)**: Passive verb meaning "is blown." The root (ن-ف-خ) relates to blowing or breathing into something.
- **ٱلصُّورِ (aṣ-ṣūr)**: "The Horn" or "The Trumpet." This is a cosmic instrument that will signal the resurrection.
- **فَتَأْتُونَ (fa-ta'tūna)**: "Then you will come." The prefix فَ (fa) indicates immediate sequence.
- **أَفْوَاجًا (afwājan)**: "In multitudes" or "in groups." The word conveys large, distinct groups or waves of people.

**Tafsir Insights:**
At-Tabari explains that the blowing of the Horn refers to the second blowing, which will resurrect the dead for judgment. The first blowing causes all creation to perish, while the second brings them back to life.

Contemporary scholar Muhammad Asad notes that the description of people coming in "multitudes" or "groups" may refer to the different religious communities or moral categories into which humanity will be divided.

**Thematic Connections:**
The Horn (Ṣūr) is mentioned in several other passages:
- "And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on." (Surah Az-Zumar 39:68)
- "And the Horn is blown; and behold from the graves they will rush forth to their Lord." (Surah Ya-Sin 36:51)

### Verse 19: The Opening of Heaven

**Arabic Text:**
وَفُتِحَتِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ فَكَانَتْ أَبْوَٰبًا

**Transliteration:**
Wa futiḥati-s-samā'u fa-kānat abwāban

**Translation:**
"And the heaven is opened and becomes as gates,"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **فُتِحَتِ (futiḥat)**: Passive verb meaning "is opened." The root (ف-ت-ح) conveys opening or beginning.
- **ٱلسَّمَآءُ (as-samā')**: "The heaven" or "the sky."
- **فَكَانَتْ (fa-kānat)**: "And it becomes" or "and it will be."
- **أَبْوَٰبًا (abwāban)**: "Gates" or "doors," plural of باب (bāb).

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Abbas explained that the heavens will be opened for the descent of the angels and for the emergence of previously unseen realms.

Contemporary scholar Syed Qutb interprets this verse as indicating that the physical laws and boundaries that currently govern our universe will be fundamentally altered, with the barrier between the seen and unseen worlds dissolving.

**Thematic Connections:**
This cosmic transformation is mentioned in other passages:
- "The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records." (Surah Al-Anbiya 21:104)
- "And the heaven is split asunder, for that Day it is frail." (Surah Al-Haqqah 69:16)

### Verse 20: The Moving of Mountains

**Arabic Text:**
وَسُيِّرَتِ ٱلْجِبَالُ فَكَانَتْ سَرَابًا

**Transliteration:**
Wa suyyirati-l-jibālu fa-kānat sarāban

**Translation:**
"And the mountains are removed and will be as a mirage."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **سُيِّرَتِ (suyyirat)**: Passive verb meaning "are set in motion" or "are removed." From the root (س-ي-ر) which relates to traveling or moving.
- **ٱلْجِبَالُ (al-jibāl)**: "The mountains," plural of جَبَل (jabal).
- **فَكَانَتْ (fa-kānat)**: "And they become" or "and they will be."
- **سَرَابًا (sarāban)**: "A mirage" or "an illusion." Something that appears to exist but has no substance.

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir notes that this verse indicates how mountains, despite their apparent solidity and permanence, will be completely pulverized and scattered, appearing like a mirage that has no substance.

Al-Tabari explains that the mountains will seem like mirages because they will be visible but will have lost their solidity and substance, similar to how a mirage appears to be water but has no reality.

**Thematic Connections:**
The transformation of mountains on the Day of Judgment is mentioned repeatedly in the Quran:
- "And they ask you about the mountains, say: 'My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust, then He will leave them as a level smooth plain.'" (Surah Ta-Ha 20:105-106)
- "And the mountains will be like carded wool." (Surah Al-Qari'ah 101:5)
- "The Day when the earth and the mountains will be in violent shake, and the mountains will be a heap of sand poured out." (Surah Al-Muzzammil 73:14)

### Verse 21: Hell Lying in Wait

**Arabic Text:**
إِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ كَانَتْ مِرْصَادًا

**Transliteration:**
Inna jahannama kānat mirṣādan

**Translation:**
"Indeed, Hell has been lying in wait,"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **إِنَّ (inna)**: Emphatic particle that stresses the certainty of what follows.
- **جَهَنَّمَ (jahannama)**: "Hell," the place of punishment in the Hereafter.
- **كَانَتْ (kānat)**: "Has been" or "was," indicating that this is an established reality.
- **مِرْصَادًا (mirṣādan)**: "An ambush" or "a place of observation." From the root (ر-ص-د) which relates to watching, waiting, or lying in ambush. This portrays Hell as a sentinel vigilantly waiting for its inhabitants.

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir describes this as meaning that Hell has been created and prepared, lying in wait for its inhabitants like an ambush. The term "mirṣādan" conveys that Hell is ready and watchful, prepared to receive the transgressors.

Imam Al-Qurtubi notes that the metaphor of an ambush indicates that Hell is not merely a passive place but is actively anticipating the arrival of disbelievers, suggesting a certain sentience or purpose in its creation.

Contemporary scholar Muhammad Asad points out that the concept of Hell "lying in wait" emphasizes the inevitability of accountability for human choices and actions.

**Thematic Connections:**
This personification of Hell as vigilant and waiting is unique, though the Quran elsewhere describes Hell as being prepared:
- "And fear the Fire, which has been prepared for the disbelievers." (Surah Al-Imran 3:131)
- "Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them." (Surah Al-Kahf 18:29)

### Verse 22: A Destination for the Transgressors

**Arabic Text:**
لِّلطَّٰغِينَ مَـَٔابًا

**Transliteration:**
Liṭ-ṭāghīna ma'āban

**Translation:**
"For the transgressors, a place of return,"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **لِّلطَّٰغِينَ (liṭ-ṭāghīna)**: "For the transgressors" or "for the rebellious ones." Derived from the root (ط-غ-ي) which conveys the meaning of exceeding limits, rebellion, or transgression. طَاغٍ (ṭāghin) refers to one who crosses boundaries set by Allah.
- **مَـَٔابًا (ma'āban)**: "A place of return" or "a destination." From the root (أ-و-ب) relating to returning or coming back. This indicates that Hell is the ultimate destination to which transgressors will return.

**Tafsir Insights:**
At-Tabari explains that "ṭāghīna" refers to those who rebel against Allah by disbelieving in Him, refusing His commands, and rejecting His messengers.

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi notes that the use of "ma'āban" (place of return) rather than simply "destination" implies that humans have an inherent link to their final abode, whether Paradise or Hell, based on their essential nature and choices.

**Thematic Connections:**
The concept of transgression (ṭughyān) appears throughout the Quran:
- "As for him who transgressed and preferred the life of this world, then indeed, Hellfire will be his abode." (Surah An-Nazi'at 79:37-39)
- "No! [But] indeed, man transgresses. Because he sees himself self-sufficient." (Surah Al-Alaq 96:6-7)

### Verse 23-24: Dwelling for Ages

**Arabic Text:**
لَّٰبِثِينَ فِيهَآ أَحْقَابًا
لَّا يَذُوقُونَ فِيهَا بَرْدًا وَلَا شَرَابًا

**Transliteration:**
Lābithīna fīhā aḥqāban
Lā yadhūqūna fīhā bardan wa lā sharāban

**Translation:**
"In which they will remain for ages.
They will not taste therein any coolness or drink,"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- **لَّٰبِثِينَ (lābithīna)**: "Remaining" or "dwelling." From the root (ل-ب-ث) which denotes staying for a long period.
- **أَحْقَابًا (aḥqāban)**: "Ages" or "long periods." Plural of حُقْب (ḥuqb), which denotes an extremely long time period.
- **يَذُوقُونَ (yadhūqūna)**: "They taste" or "they experience." From the root (ذ-و-ق) relating to tasting or experiencing.
- **بَرْدًا (bardan)**: "Coolness" or "relief." In the scorching heat of Hell, coolness would represent comfort or relief.
- **شَرَابًا (sharāban)**: "Drink" or "beverage." From the root (ش-ر-ب) relating to drinking.

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Abbas and others explain that "aḥqāban" refers to continuous, successive periods with no end. One ḥuqb was variously interpreted as eighty, seventy, or forty years, but the plural form and context suggest an indefinite, prolonged duration.

Al-Qurtubi notes that the denial of "coolness" (bard) is particularly significant as it was Arab custom to seek shade and cool places for relief from the desert heat. The absence of coolness and drink represents the complete denial of comfort or relief.

**Thematic Connections:**
The duration of punishment in Hell is mentioned in other verses:
- "They will abide therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills. Indeed, your Lord is an effecter of what He intends." (Surah Hud 11:107)

The deprivation of comfort is also emphasized elsewhere:
- "No food will there be for them except from a poisonous, thorny plant which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger." (Surah Al-Ghashiyah 88:6-7)

## In-Depth Commentary

### The Day of Judgment as an Appointment (verse 17)

The passage begins by establishing the inevitability of the Day of Judgment. The use of the term "مِيقَٰتًا" (appointed time) is significant because it indicates that:

1. The Day of Judgment is precisely scheduled in Allah's knowledge
2. It is a definite event that cannot be postponed or avoided
3. It represents a cosmic appointment where all creation will be present

This verse sets the stage for the detailed description that follows by emphasizing the certainty of this day. The Arabic word "الفصل" (al-fasl) literally means "separation" or "decision," indicating that this is the day when truth will be separated from falsehood and decisive judgments will be made about all matters.

### The Cosmic Signs (verses 18-20)

These verses describe three major cosmic events that will occur on the Day of Judgment:

1. **The blowing of the Horn (as-Sur)**: Traditionally understood to be blown by the angel Israfil, this marks the resurrection of all souls. The "multitudes" (أَفْوَاجًا) refer to how humanity will be gathered in distinct groups, possibly according to their beliefs or deeds.

2. **The opening of the sky**: The description of the sky becoming "gateways" (أَبْوَٰبًا) suggests that the normal barriers between the earthly and celestial realms will be removed. Some commentators suggest this refers to angels descending in great numbers, while others interpret it as the complete restructuring of the cosmos.

3. **The removal of mountains**: The mountains, symbols of permanence and stability in the worldly life, will become like a mirage (سَرَابًا). This powerful image shows how the seemingly most permanent features of our world will vanish or lose their substance, highlighting the transience of the material world compared to the eternal reality.

These three cosmic signs dramatically illustrate how the familiar order of existence will be completely transformed, preparing for the final judgment.

### Hell as an Ambush (verses 21-22)

The description of Hell as "lying in wait" (مِرْصَادًا) uses a term that originally referred to an ambush or observation post. This powerful imagery suggests:

1. Hell is vigilantly watching for its inhabitants
2. It is ready to seize the transgressors
3. There is no escape from divine justice

The word "طَّٰغِينَ" (transgressors) comes from a root meaning "to exceed proper bounds." This indicates that Hell is specifically prepared for those who deliberately cross the limits set by Allah, showing rebelliousness and arrogance rather than mere error.

### The Nature of Punishment (verses 23-26)

These verses describe the horrific nature of punishment in Hell:

1. **Duration**: The term "أَحْقَابًا" (ages) suggests an extremely long, if not eternal, stay. Classical scholars have debated whether this indicates an eventual end or refers to continuous, unending cycles of time.

2. **Absence of relief**: The denial of "coolness" (بَرْدًا) and "drink" (شَرَابًا) represents the absence of any form of relief or comfort. In the hot desert context where the Quran was revealed, this would symbolize extreme torment.

3. **Painful substitutes**: Instead of cool water, the inhabitants receive "scalding water" (حَمِيمًا) and "purulence" (غَسَّاقًا) - which is discharge from wounds.

4. **Divine justice**: The punishment is described as "appropriate recompense" (جَزَآءً وِفَاقًا), indicating that it precisely matches the nature and degree of the sins committed. This emphasizes Allah's perfect justice, not arbitrary punishment.

### The Reasons for Punishment (verses 27-28)

These verses explain why the transgressors deserve such punishment:

1. **Disbelief in accountability**: They "were not expecting an account" (لَا يَرْجُونَ حِسَابًا), meaning they lived as if there would be no reckoning for their actions.

2. **Rejection of divine signs**: They "denied Our signs with [emphatic] denial" (كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا كِذَّابًا). The repetition of the root ك-ذ-ب emphasizes the intensity and persistence of their denial.

These verses illustrate that the punishment is directly connected to the fundamental attitudes
