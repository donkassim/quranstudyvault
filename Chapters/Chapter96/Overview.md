## Summary
Surah Al-Alaq holds a special place in Islamic history as it contains the first verses revealed to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in the Cave of Hira through Angel Jibreel. The surah begins with the command "Read!" and emphasizes the importance of knowledge, learning, and the use of the pen. It introduces fundamental Islamic concepts including Allah as Creator and the Most Generous, who taught humans what they knew not. The later verses (revealed at a different time) warn against human arrogance and transgression, particularly referencing Abu Jahl's opposition to the Prophet's worship, and ends with a call to prostration and drawing near to Allah.

## Main Themes
1. **Knowledge and Education**: Emphasizes reading, writing, and learning as divinely ordained activities
2. **Divine Creation**: Highlights Allah as Creator who formed humans from a clot of blood
3. **Divine Generosity**: Allah taught humanity through the pen what they did not know
4. **Human Arrogance**: Warns against human tendency towards transgression when they feel self-sufficient
5. **Opposition to Truth**: Addresses those who prevent others from worship and prayer
6. **Nearness to Allah**: Concludes with the importance of prostration and drawing closer to Allah

## Historical Context
This surah marks the beginning of Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) prophethood around 610 CE. The first five verses were revealed when the Prophet was meditating in the Cave of Hira, and Angel Jibreel appeared to him, embraced him, and commanded him to "Read!" The Prophet, who was unlettered, responded that he could not read, after which Jibreel embraced him again and repeated the command. This happened three times before the Angel recited the first five verses. These verses initiated the Prophet's mission and the revelation of the Quran.

The latter part of the surah (verses 6-19) was revealed later, likely in response to the opposition faced by the Prophet, particularly from Abu Jahl, who threatened to physically harm the Prophet if he continued to pray near the Ka'bah.
