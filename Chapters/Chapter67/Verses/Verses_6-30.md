# Detailed Analysis of Surah Al-Mulk (Chapter 67) - Verses 6-30

## Introduction

This analysis examines verses 6-30 of Surah Al-Mulk, completing our study of this powerful chapter. While the first five verses established Allah's absolute sovereignty and the purpose of creation, these remaining verses develop several interconnected themes: the consequences of disbelief, Allah's complete knowledge and power, humanity's dependence on Allah, and the certainty of resurrection and judgment.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Section 1: The Fate of Disbelievers (Verses 6-11)

#### Verse 6

**Original Arabic:**
وَلِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ

**Translation:**
"And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and wretched is the destination."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- The verse begins with the preposition "li" (for/to) connected to "alladhīna kafarū" (those who disbelieved), immediately establishing consequences
- "Bi-rabbihim" (in their Lord) - the specific mention of disbelief in "their Lord" emphasizes the personal relationship being rejected
- "ʿAdhābu jahannama" (punishment of Hell) - "ʿAdhāb" comes from the root ʿ-dh-b, indicating intense suffering
- "Wa-bi'sa al-maṣīr" (and wretched is the destination) - "bi'sa" is used for extreme condemnation

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir notes that after mentioning the perfection of His creation, Allah immediately mentions the punishment prepared for those who disbelieve despite these clear signs. This creates a powerful contrast between the beauty of creation and the consequence of rejecting its Creator.

Al-Qurtubi emphasizes that the verse definitively establishes that Hell exists already, as it is referred to in the present tense as an existing destination.

**Thematic Connections:**
This verse creates a transition from discussing Allah's creative power to the consequences of denying it, connecting to similar passages in Surah Furqan (25:11-14) and Surah Ibrahim (14:28-29).

#### Verse 7

**Original Arabic:**
إِذَآ أُلْقُوا۟ فِيهَا سَمِعُوا۟ لَهَا شَهِيقًا وَهِىَ تَفُورُ

**Translation:**
"When they are thrown into it, they hear from it a [dreadful] inhaling while it boils up."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Ulqū" (they are thrown) - the passive voice emphasizes their powerlessness
- "Shahīqan" (inhaling/gasping) - describes a terrible sound like braying or the inhale of a donkey
- "Tafūru" (boiling/bubbling up) - from "fawaran" meaning to boil or overflow with rage

**Tafsir Insights:**
Imam al-Tabari explains that "shahīq" is the sound of Hell's "inhalation" as it draws in the disbelievers, depicting Hell as almost alive and breathing in rage.

Al-Zamakhshari notes the use of sensory imagery (sound of inhaling and boiling) creates a vivid, terrifying picture that appeals to human fear through concrete sensory experiences.

**Thematic Connections:**
This auditory description of Hell connects to other sensory descriptions in the Quran, such as in Surah Mulk verse 8 and Surah Furqan verses 11-12, creating a comprehensive sensory warning.

#### Verse 8

**Original Arabic:**
تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ ٱلْغَيْظِ ۖ كُلَّمَآ أُلْقِىَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ

**Translation:**
"It almost bursts with rage. Every time a group is thrown into it, its keepers ask them, 'Did there not come to you a warner?'"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Tamayyazu" (bursts/tears apart) - conveys extreme anger to the point of disintegration
- "Min al-ghayz" (from rage) - intense anger and indignation
- "Fawjun" (group) - refers to a cohort or company of people
- "Khazanatuhā" (its keepers) - from "khazana" meaning to store or guard
- "Nadhīr" (warner) - one who gives advance warning of danger

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Abbas commented that this verse personifies Hell as having emotions, stating Hell's rage is directed at those who disobey Allah despite His clear warnings.

Contemporary scholar Muhammad Asad notes the dialogue that follows emphasizes that divine punishment is not arbitrary but a consequence of rejecting clear guidance.

**Thematic Connections:**
The questioning by the guardians of Hell is a recurring theme in the Quran, appearing also in Surah Zumar (39:71) and Surah Al-Mulk (67:8-9), highlighting human accountability.

#### Verse 9

**Original Arabic:**
قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَآءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِى ضَلَـٰلٍ كَبِيرٍ

**Translation:**
"They will say, 'Yes, a warner had come to us, but we denied and said, 'Allah has not sent down anything. You are not but in great error.'"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Balā" (yes indeed) - an emphatic affirmation
- "Kadhdhabnā" (we denied) - active acknowledgment of their denial
- "Mā nazzala Allāhu min shay'" (Allah has not sent down anything) - complete rejection of revelation
- "Ḍalālin kabīr" (great error) - implies a massive deviation from truth

**Tafsir Insights:**
Al-Razi points out the irony that they accused the messengers of being in "great error," but they themselves were the truly misguided ones.

Ibn Kathir notes that this confession demonstrates that the punishment is just, as they admit receiving the message but willfully rejecting it.

**Thematic Connections:**
The theme of people admitting their guilt in the Hereafter appears in several places in the Quran, including Surah Al-A'raf (7:37) and Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:106-108).

#### Verse 10

**Original Arabic:**
وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِىٓ أَصْحَـٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ

**Translation:**
"And they will say, 'If only we had listened or reasoned, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze.'"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Nasmaʿu" (we had listened) - active listening that leads to acceptance
- "Naʿqilu" (we had reasoned) - from "ʿaql" meaning intellect/reason
- "Aṣḥāb al-saʿīr" (companions of the Blaze) - those permanently associated with the raging fire

**Tafsir Insights:**
Al-Qurtubi observes that this verse identifies the two faculties humans should use to recognize truth: hearing (revelation) and intellect (reasoning), both of which the disbelievers failed to employ properly.

Modern scholar Syed Qutb emphasizes how this verse shows that faith is not against reason but requires it; disbelief is often the result of not using one's rational faculties properly.

**Thematic Connections:**
The Quran repeatedly emphasizes the importance of both listening and reasoning, as in Surah Al-Anfal (8:22) and Surah Al-Hajj (22:46).

#### Verse 11

**Original Arabic:**
فَٱعْتَرَفُوا۟ بِذَنۢبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًا لِّأَصْحَـٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ

**Translation:**
"So they will acknowledge their sins, but [it will be said], 'Away with the companions of the Blaze!'"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Fa-ʿtarafū" (they acknowledged) - from "iʿtirāf" meaning confession or admission
- "Bi-dhanbihim" (their sins) - from "dhanb" meaning sin or offense
- "Fa-suḥqan" (so away/distant) - expresses removal and distance, a form of dismissal
- The structure "fa-suḥqan" is a verbal noun in the accusative case, used here as an expression of contempt

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir states that this admission comes too late to benefit them, as acknowledgment is only beneficial during the time of accountability in worldly life.

Al-Tabari notes that "suḥqan" (away/distance) is an expression of exclusion from Allah's mercy, the ultimate loss.

**Thematic Connections:**
This theme of belated acknowledgment appears elsewhere, such as in Surah Ghafir (40:11-12) and Surah Al-A'raf (7:37), emphasizing that recognition of truth must come during earthly life.

### Section 2: Allah's Knowledge and Human Accountability (Verses 12-15)

#### Verse 12

**Original Arabic:**
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ

**Translation:**
"Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Yakhshawna" (they fear) - from "khashya" meaning reverent fear mixed with awe
- "Bil-ghayb" (unseen) - they fear Allah without seeing Him, based on faith
- "Maghfiratun" (forgiveness) - from "ghafara" meaning to cover or conceal sins
- "Ajrun kabīr" (great reward) - immense compensation that cannot be quantified

**Tafsir Insights:**
Al-Razi contrasts this verse with the previous section about disbelievers, noting that after mentioning punishment, Allah mentions reward, balancing warning with hope.

Ibn 'Ashur explains that fearing Allah "unseen" means either fearing Him though He is unseen to us, or fearing Him in private when no one else sees us—both interpretations enrich the meaning.

**Thematic Connections:**
The concept of fearing Allah in private appears in several places, including Surah Yaseen (36:11) and Surah Qaf (50:33), emphasizing sincerity of faith.

#### Verse 13

**Original Arabic:**
وَأَسِرُّوا۟ قَوْلَكُمْ أَوِ ٱجْهَرُوا۟ بِهِۦٓ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ

**Translation:**
"And conceal your speech or publicize it; indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Asirrū" (conceal) - from "sirr" meaning secret
- "Ijharū" (publicize) - from "jahr" meaning to announce openly
- "ʿAlīmun" (Knowing) - intensive form indicating comprehensive knowledge
- "Bi-dhāti al-ṣudūr" (within the breasts) - refers to innermost thoughts and intentions

**Tafsir Insights:**
Al-Qurtubi explains that this verse abolishes the misconception that Allah only knows what is declared openly, emphasizing His complete knowledge.

Modern scholar Muhammad Abdel Haleem notes how this verse establishes that there is no distinction between private and public speech in terms of Allah's awareness, eliminating any sense of secrecy from Allah.

**Thematic Connections:**
Allah's knowledge of innermost thoughts is highlighted in many verses, including Surah Qaf (50:16) and Surah Ta-Ha (20:7).

#### Verse 14

**Original Arabic:**
أَلَا يَعْلَمُ مَنْ خَلَقَ وَهُوَ ٱللَّطِيفُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ

**Translation:**
"Does He who created not know, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted?"

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "A-lā yaʿlamu" (Does He not know) - rhetorical question expecting affirmative answer
- "Al-Laṭīf" (the Subtle) - One who is aware of subtleties and intricacies
- "Al-Khabīr" (the Acquainted) - One who has perfect, experienced knowledge

**Tafsir Insights:**
Ibn Kathir presents this rhetorical question as an argument from greater to lesser: if Allah created everything, surely He knows everything about His creation.

Al-Sa'di points out the logical connection: the Creator necessarily knows His creation better than it knows itself, as creation implies both knowledge and intent.

**Thematic Connections:**
This logical argument about the Creator's knowledge also appears in Surah Al-Mulk (67:14) and Surah Yasin (36:79), establishing a consistent theme about divine knowledge.

#### Verse 15

**Original Arabic:**
هُوَ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ ذَلُولًا فَٱمْشُوا۟ فِى مَنَاكِبِهَا وَكُلُوا۟ مِن رِّزْقِهِۦ ۖ وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلنُّشُورُ

**Translation:**
"It is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision - and to Him is the resurrection."

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- "Dhalūlan" (tame/subdued) - from the same root as "dhallala" (to humble), describing earth as made manageable
- "Manākib" (slopes/pathways
