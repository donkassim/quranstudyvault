# Surah Al-Mulk (67) - Verses 1-5: The Foundation of Divine Sovereignty

## Introduction

The opening five verses of Surah Al-Mulk establish the fundamental theme of Allah's absolute sovereignty (mulk) over all creation. These verses emphasize Allah's power, the perfection of His creation, and His dominion over life and death. They lay the theological foundation for the entire surah, introducing key concepts that will be elaborated throughout the chapter.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1: Declaration of Divine Sovereignty

#### Arabic Text and Translation
تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ

*"Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things."*

#### Linguistic Analysis
- **تَبَارَكَ (Tabāraka)**: Derived from the root "b-r-k" (blessing), this word implies an abundance of blessings and goodness. Unlike "bāraka" (he blessed), "tabāraka" is in a form that indicates permanence, immensity, and self-generation of blessing. It is exclusively used for Allah in the Quran.
  
- **بِيَدِهِ (bi-yadihi)**: Literally "in His Hand," this is an anthropomorphic expression denoting Allah's complete power and control. The singular "hand" emphasizes the unity and exclusivity of His control.
  
- **الْمُلْكُ (al-mulk)**: Sovereignty, dominion, or kingdom. This is the key term that gives the surah its name. It encompasses the concepts of ownership, authority, control, and governance of all existence.
  
- **قَدِيرٌ (qadīr)**: All-Powerful or Omnipotent, derived from "qudrah" (power). This attribute means Allah has the power to do anything He wills without limitation.

#### Tafsir Insights
- **Ibn Kathir**: Notes that Allah begins with "tabāraka" to emphasize His exalted status and the greatness of His blessing. The Hand of dominion indicates that all affairs return to Him alone.
  
- **Al-Qurtubi**: Points out that "al-mulk" here refers to Allah's complete ownership of both the seen and unseen realms, the worldly life and the Hereafter.
  
- **Al-Razi**: Explains that mentioning Allah's dominion followed by His omnipotence establishes that He not only owns everything but has complete ability to dispose of His kingdom however He wills.

- **Contemporary scholars**: Connect this verse to the concept of Tawhid al-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Lordship), emphasizing that true sovereignty belongs only to Allah, with implications for both spiritual and social dimensions of human life.

#### Thematic Connections
- Similar declarations of Allah's sovereignty appear in Surah Al-Hashr (59:23), Surah Al-Jumu'ah (62:1), and Surah Al-Taghabun (64:1).
  
- This sovereignty theme connects to Surah Ya-Sin (36:83): "So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things."
  
- The usage of "tabāraka" also appears at the beginning of Surah Al-Furqan (25:1), similarly emphasizing Allah's exalted status.

### Verse 2: The Divine Test through Creation

#### Arabic Text and Translation
الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ

*"[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving."*

#### Linguistic Analysis
- **خَلَقَ (khalaqa)**: Created or brought into existence from nothingness. Using this term for "death" is significant as it establishes death as a created entity, not merely the absence of life.
  
- **الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ (al-mawta wal-ḥayāh)**: Death and life. Notably, death is mentioned before life, contrary to the natural order we might expect. This rhetorical inversion has been interpreted in various ways by scholars.
  
- **لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ (li-yabluwakum)**: To test you. From "balā" (test or trial), indicating examination that reveals true quality.
  
- **أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا (aḥsanu ʿamalan)**: Best in deed. Not merely most numerous in deeds, but best in quality. "Aḥsan" refers to excellence, beauty, and perfection in action.
  
- **الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ (al-ʿazīz al-ghafūr)**: The Exalted in Might, the Forgiving. This pairing of divine attributes balances power with mercy.

#### Tafsir Insights
- **Ibn Abbas**: Reportedly said that "best in deed" refers to those most abstinent regarding worldly matters and most careful about what Allah has forbidden.
  
- **Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad**: Defined "best in deed" as that which is most sincere and most correct—sincere meaning done solely for Allah, and correct meaning in accordance with the Sunnah.
  
- **Imam Al-Ghazali**: Elaborates that mentioning death before life indicates that our current existence is bounded by two nonexistences—one preceding our birth and one following our death.
  
- **Contemporary scholars**: Emphasize that this verse provides the teleological purpose of human existence—to be tested through deeds—which gives meaning to life and explains suffering as part of divine wisdom.

#### Thematic Connections
- The theme of life as a test appears in multiple places in the Quran, including Surah Al-Kahf (18:7): "Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth as adornment for it that We may test them [as to] which of them is best in deed."
  
- The mention of death and life as created entities connects to the broader Quranic theme of Allah's complete control over existence and non-existence, as in Surah Al-Rum (30:40).
  
- The pairing of divine attributes (Exalted in Might, Forgiving) appears in similar formulations throughout the Quran, balancing Allah's power with His mercy.

### Verse 3: The Perfection of Creation

#### Arabic Text and Translation
الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا ۖ مَّا تَرَىٰ فِي خَلْقِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ مِن تَفَاوُتٍ ۖ فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍ

*"[And] who created seven heavens in layers. You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks?"*

#### Linguistic Analysis
- **سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ (sabʿa samāwāt)**: Seven heavens. The number seven in Arabic can sometimes denote multiplicity rather than a specific quantity.
  
- **طِبَاقًا (ṭibāqan)**: In layers, one above another. This could refer to their physical arrangement or to their correspondence with each other.
  
- **تَفَاوُتٍ (tafāwut)**: Inconsistency, disproportion, or discrepancy. From a root meaning difference or variation that implies imperfection.
  
- **فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ (fa-irjiʿi l-baṣara)**: Return your vision or look again. An invitation to careful, repeated observation.
  
- **فُطُورٍ (fuṭūr)**: Breaks, cracks, or rifts. Anything that would indicate imperfection or weakness in structure.

#### Tafsir Insights
- **Ibn Kathir**: Explains that Allah challenges humans to find any fault in His creation, emphasizing the perfection of divine handiwork that reflects His wisdom.
  
- **Al-Tabari**: Interprets the seven heavens as literal celestial spheres arranged in layers, with our visible sky being the lowest.
  
- **Fakhr al-Din al-Razi**: Argues that this verse serves as both a cosmological statement and a logical argument for Allah's wisdom and power. If there were inconsistencies in creation, it would indicate weakness in the Creator.
  
- **Contemporary interpretation**: Some scholars connect this verse to modern scientific observations about the harmony and fine-tuning of universal constants that allow life to exist, seeing this as confirmation of divine design.

#### Thematic Connections
- The concept of seven heavens appears in multiple Quranic passages, including Surah Al-Baqarah (2:29), Surah Al-Isra (17:44), and Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:86).
  
- The theme of creation's perfection as evidence for Allah's power appears in Surah Al-Naml (27:88) and Surah Al-Rahman (55:5-7).
  
- The challenge to "look again" is similar to challenges in Surah Al-Infitar (82:7): "Who created you, proportioned you, and balanced you."

### Verse 4: The Challenge to Observe Repeatedly

#### Arabic Text and Translation
ثُمَّ ارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ الْبَصَرُ خَاسِئًا وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ

*"Then return [your] vision twice again. [Your] vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued."*

#### Linguistic Analysis
- **كَرَّتَيْنِ (karratayni)**: Twice again or two more times. The dual form emphasizes repeated observation.
  
- **يَنقَلِبْ (yanqalib)**: Will return or turn back. From "inqilāb" (revolution or turning over), suggesting a complete reversal.
  
- **خَاسِئًا (khāsiʾan)**: Humiliated, driven away, or unsuccessful. Often used to describe dogs being driven away, conveying strong dismissal.
  
- **حَسِيرٌ (ḥasīr)**: Fatigued, worn out, or diminished. Refers to the state of being unable to continue due to exhaustion.

#### Tafsir Insights
- **Mujahid**: Stated that "vision will return humbled" means that one's sight will find no flaw after careful examination.
  
- **Al-Zamakhshari**: Explains that this repetition is a rhetorical device emphasizing the impossibility of finding any flaw, even with repeated attempts.
  
- **Ibn Ashur**: Notes that "fatigued" vision is a metaphor for the complete inability to find what is being sought after exhaustive effort.
  
- **Contemporary scholars**: See this as establishing an empirical approach to discovering divine signs, encouraging humans to observe the universe scientifically while acknowledging the limitations of human perception.

#### Thematic Connections
- The theme of human limitation in comprehending Allah's creation appears in Surah Al-Rahman (55:33), challenging humanity to penetrate beyond the zones of heaven and earth.
  
- Similar challenges to observe and reflect on creation appear in Surah Al-Ghashiyah (88:17-20): "Then do they not look at the camels - how they are created?"
  
- The concept of sensory or intellectual fatigue appears in Surah Al-Kahf (18:42-43), where a man whose garden is destroyed "began to turn his hands about" in regret.

### Verse 5: The Beautiful Lower Heaven

#### Arabic Text and Translation
وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَابِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَاهَا رُجُومًا لِّلشَّيَاطِينِ ۖ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ

*"And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made [from] them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze."*

#### Linguistic Analysis
- **زَيَّنَّا (zayyannā)**: We have beautified or adorned. From "zīnah" (beauty or adornment), indicating purposeful aesthetic design.
  
- **السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا (al-samāʾa al-dunyā)**: The nearest heaven or lower sky. "Dunya" implies both proximity and a connection to the worldly realm.
  
- **مَصَابِيحَ (maṣābīḥ)**: Lamps or stars. From "miṣbāḥ" (lamp), metaphorically describing stars as sources of light.
  
- **رُجُومًا (rujūman)**: Missiles or projectiles. From "rajm" (stoning or projecting), referring to shooting stars or meteors.
  
- **السَّعِيرِ (al-saʿīr)**: The Blaze. One of the names for Hellfire, emphasizing its burning intensity.

#### Tafsir Insights
- **Ibn Abbas**: Reported to have said that stars serve three purposes: adornment of the heaven, missiles against devils, and signs for navigation.
  
- **Al-Tabari**: Explains that the "missiles" refer to shooting stars that repel devils who attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly council.
  
- **Al-Qurtubi**: Notes that this verse combines Allah's creative beauty with His protective justice, showing both aesthetic and functional aspects of cosmic design.
  
- **Contemporary interpretation**: Some scholars interpret this verse in light of modern astronomy, seeing the "nearest heaven" as our observable universe and the "missiles" as a metaphorical description of cosmic phenomena like meteors.

#### Thematic Connections
- The theme of stars as adornment appears in Surah Al-Saffat (37:6-10), which similarly mentions stars as both beautification and protection against devils.
  
- The concept of heavens as structured, purposeful creation connects to Surah Fussilat (41:12): "And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection."
  
- The mention of punishment for devils parallels Surah Al-Jinn (72:8-9), which describes how jinn find the heaven "filled with stern guards and burning flames."
