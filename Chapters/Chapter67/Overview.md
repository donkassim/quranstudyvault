## Historical Context

Surah Al-Mulk was revealed during the later Meccan period when opposition to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his message was intense. During this challenging time, the early Muslims needed reassurance about Allah's power and ultimate justice. The surah provided comfort to believers facing persecution by reminding them of Allah's absolute sovereignty over the universe and the ephemeral nature of worldly power.

The themes of the surah directly addressed the doubts raised by the Meccan polytheists about resurrection and accountability in the Hereafter, using logical arguments and references to the observable universe as evidence of divine power.

## Virtues and Benefits of Recitation

Surah Al-Mulk holds a special place among the chapters of the Quran due to the numerous hadiths highlighting its virtues:

1. **Protection from the Grave**: The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said, "There is a surah in the Quran of thirty verses that intercedes for its reciter until he is forgiven: Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion (i.e., Surah Al-Mulk)." (Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud)

2. **Nightly Recitation**: The Prophet ﷺ used to recite Al-Mulk every night before sleeping and advised his companions to do the same.

3. **Intercession on the Day of Judgment**: It is reported that the surah will intercede for its regular reciter on the Day of Judgment.

4. **Prevention from Punishment**: According to tradition, the surah is also known as "Al-Mani'ah" (The Preventer) because it shields its reciter from the punishment of the grave.

5. **Spiritual Protection**: Many scholars recommend its recitation for spiritual protection and as a means of strengthening one's faith.
